# Company Tracker - MVC architecture

## *Devin Annunzio*

**Company Tracker** is a simple CRUD app utilizing MVC architecture using Java, servlets, tomcat, and mySql.  The app allows a user to add a company he may want to follow.  The user can register a company name, ceo, and headquarters location to the database.   Currently, the stock price is not able to be changed as I plan to fetch the live data using an API in a future update.

## Functionality

The current functionality:
* [✅] The user can add a company to their list
* [✅] The user can delete a company from their list
* [✅] Create an edit field for if the user wants to change some information in database

## Future plans
Future ideas to implement:
* [] Work on UI to make it more presentable
* [] Possibly fetch stock price from a web API using the update tab
* [] Possibly add form validation with JS
* [] Possibly add SSL and authentication
